    "> This exercise has been written out in something called a Jupyter Notebook. We'll discuss Jupyter Notebooks in more detail later in this specialization—they are very a powerful tool for data science communication!—but for the time being, the notebook is just a convenient way for us to write out the exercise. You don't need to *do* anything with the notebook except read its contents—just use write your Python code in a regular `.py` file.\n",

    "> When asked to round your answers to a certain number of decimals, do *not* round any results until you've finished your computations and have your final answer! For example, if you were to calculate the average hourly wage for workers, and you did so by first calculating the average weekly salary of workers and the average hours worked per week, then divided the first number by the second, you should NOT round the average weekly salary of workers or the average hours worked per week. Rounding intermediate results can lead to compounding errors that cause problems for the autograder.\n",

    "In order to convert `age` into a numeric variable, we need to replace those problematic entries with values that `pandas` can later convert into numbers. Pick appropriate substitutions for the existing values and replace the current values. \n",

    "**Hint 1:** Categorical variables act like strings, so you might want to use string methods! \n",

    "\n",
    "**Hint 3:** Because the US Census has been conducted regularly for hundreds of years but exactly how the census has been conducted has occasionally changed, variables are sometimes coded in a way that might be interpreted in different ways for different census years. For example, hypothetically, one might write `90 (90+ in 1980 and 1990)` if the Censuses conducted in 1980 and 1990 used to top-code age at 90 (any values *over* 90 were just coded as 90), but more recent Censuses no longer top-coded age and recorded ages over 90 as the respondent's actual age. We're only working with more recent data, so anyone with a value of `90 (90+ in 1980 and 1990)` can safely be assumed to be 90 years old."
