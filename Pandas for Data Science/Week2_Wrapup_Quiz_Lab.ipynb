    "# Week 2 Quiz: Manipulating DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: \n",
    "\n",
    "> This exercise has been written out in something called a Jupyter Notebook. We'll discuss Jupyter Notebooks in more detail later in this specialization—they are very a powerful tool for data science communication!—but for the time being, the notebook is just a convenient way for us to write out the exercise. You don't need to *do* anything with the notebook except read its contents—just use write your Python code in a regular `.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**WARNING:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> When asked to round your answers to a certain number of decimals, do *not* round any results until you've finished your computations and have your final answer! For example, if you were to calculate the average hourly wage for workers, and you did so by first calculating the average weekly salary of workers and the average hours worked per week, then divided the first number by the second, you should NOT round the average weekly salary of workers or the  average hours worked per week. Rounding intermediate results can lead to compounding errors that cause problems for the autograder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Estimating Labor Market Returns to Education\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we're going to use data from the [American Communities Survey (ACS)](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/acs.shtml) to study the relationship between educational attainment and wages. The ACS is a survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau (though it is not \"The Census,\" which is a counting of every person in the United States that takes place every 10 years) to measure numerous features of the US population. The data we will be working with includes about 100 variables from the 2017 ACS survey, and is a 10% sample of the ACS (which itself is a 1% sample of the US population, so we're working with about a 0.1% sample of the United States). \n",
    "\n",
    "This data comes from [IPUMS](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/), which provides a very useful tool for getting subsets of major survey datasets, not just from the US, but [from government statistical agencies the world over](https://international.ipums.org/international-action/sample_details).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is *real* data, meaning that you are being provided the data as it is provided by IPUMS. Documentation for all variables used in this data can be found [here](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/group) (you can either search by variable name to figure out the meaning of a variable in this data, or search for something you want to see if a variable with the right name is in this data). \n",
    "\n",
    "Within this data is information on both the educational background and current earnings of a representative sample of Americans. We will now use this data to estimate the labor-market returns to graduating high school and college, and to learn something about the meaning of an educational degree. "

    "Import `US_ACS_2017_10pct_sample.dta` into a pandas DataFrame. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done with the command `pd.read_stata(\"US_ACS_2017_10pct_sample.dta\")`, which will read in files created in the program Stata (and which uses the file suffix `.dta`). This is a format commonly used by social scientists. We will discuss the range of tools for importing data built into pandas in more detail next week!"

    "Congratulations! You just discovered \"the sheepskin effect!\": people with degrees tend to earn substantially more than people who have *almost* as much education, but don't have an actual degree. \n",

If that were the case, we would expect employee earnings to rise with every year of high school, since in each year of high school we learn more. \n",

    "Instead, this suggests employees pay high school graduates more because they think *the kind of people* who can finish high school are the *kind of people* who are likely to succeed at their jobs. Finishing high school, in other words, isn't about accumulating specific knowledge; it's about showing that you *are the kind of person* who can rise to the challenge of finishing high school, also suggesting you are also the kind of person who can succeed as an employee. \n",
