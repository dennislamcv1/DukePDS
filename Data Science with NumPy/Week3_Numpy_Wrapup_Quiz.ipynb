    "> This exercise has been written out in something called a Jupyter Notebook. We'll discuss Jupyter Notebooks in more detail later in the courseâ€”they are very a powerful tool for data science communication!â€”but for the time being, the notebook is just a convenient way for us to write out the exercise. You don't need to *do* anything with the notebook except read its contentsâ€”just use write your Python code in a regular `.py` file.\n",

    "As previously discussed, we frequently use matrices and data science because they are a natural format for representing data generated by collecting the same type of information from numerous entities. For example, below is a toy dataset that you could imagine was created by collecting information about employees at a companyâ€”each column is a different type of information being collected (income, age, years of education), and each row is the information about a different employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following questions, you will be asked to answer a number of questions about this toy dataset. As with other exercises in this class, you will find the directions for this graded exercise here, but please submit your actual answers in the graded quiz."

    "\n",
    "As noted above, the fifth column of our data contains something called \"sampling weights.\" That's because when the government conducted this survey, they didn't draw a random sample of respondents from the US population where everyone had the same probability of being interviewed. As a result, when we calculate the average hourly wage of the people in the survey, it isn't *quite* the best estimate we have for the average hourly wage for everyone working in the United States. To calculate this number as accurately as possible, we have to take into account the fact that some respondents in the data were more likely to be included than others, and thus can be thought of as standing in for a smaller group of people in the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would the government do this? The main reason is that if we want to make statements about a group in a survey like this, the accuracy of those statements will depend on the number of individuals who have actually ended up taking the survey. If we are interested in a big groupâ€”like White menâ€”we are almost guaranteed to have enough of them in any reasonably sized survey to be able to make accurate statements about that subpopulation. But if we were interested in the life experiences of, say, people in their twenties who have a high school diploma but never attended college, and who live in rural communities, we may have to make a deliberate effort to ensure that there are more of those people in our survey than when we would get if we just took a random sample where everyone in the United States had the same probability of being included.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned above, for the questions above, the sampling weights don't make a very big difference to our answers, but the way to get the *most accurate* estimates would be to take them into account. So let's give that a try!\n",
    "\n",
    "When we calculate the average of a variable, we do so by multiplying all the values of the variable by $1/N$ (where $N$ is the number of observations we have) and then adding up those multiplied values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a *weighted* average, we take the value for each observation $i$ and multiply it by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$weight_i / \\sum_{j=1}^N weights_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $weight_i$ is the observation's weight, and $\\sum_{j=1}^N weights_j$ is the total of all the weights in the population being averaged. Then we just add up those values!\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that, what is the average hourly wage of Americans working full-time jobs (i.e., the group in this survey) taking into account survey weights (rounded to **two** decimal places)?\n"
